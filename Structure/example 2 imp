 //b2.title="c++ is one of good languages"; It is worng because b2.title act as array and it denotes the base address of array
 // that is definitely a constant so we can not put a constant in right side of equal to sign
  b2.price =700;

  // how to assign the value of b2 to b3
  //b3.bookid=b2.bookid; or
  b3=b2;// because they have same data type


  cout<<" the book id ="<<b1.bookid<<endl;
