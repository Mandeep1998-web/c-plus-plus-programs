The difference between class and structure is that member of the class is  private by default, and in structure it is public by default.
.=> 
// Member function(show) can directly access the variable of the class (a,b).
//member function can directly access the member of its class like we didn't pass anything in show function.
// we can write the function outside a class but we have to write MEMBERSHIP LABEL (complex ::)

=>
#class is description of object or blueprint of object and object is an instance of class.
#INSTANCE MEMBER VARIABLE =Attributes,variables,properties.
#INSTANCE MEMBER FUNCTION = Methods, procedures, actions, services.
