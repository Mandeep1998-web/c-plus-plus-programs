Function overloading : when one function is overloaded with multiple jobs it is called function overloading.
   int man(int x) or int man(double x)============it can be used as a function overloading
   but if the signature(man(int x) is same then it is not function overloading.)
   
   
   RULES FOR FUNCTION OVERLOADING::::::::
(and if one of them are appropriate to determine then no need of other rule)
   1. EXACT MATCH
   2. TYPE PROMOTION(char promote to int and float promote to double)
   3. TYPE CONVERSION. (TYPE CONVERSION IS POSSIBLE ONLY PRIMITITVE DATA TYPE)
   (IF ALL THREE FAIL THEN ERROR) 
   ==============================================================================
   FUNCTION OVERLOADING IS POSSIBLE IF THE SCOPE OF BOTH THE FUNCTION IS IN SAME CLASS.
   IF THE OBJECT, THE CALL, THE FUNCTION IS IN CHILD CLASS THEN IT GOES TO CHILD CLASS otherwise  THAT OF PARENT CLASS WHATEVER THE RETURN TYPE 
   ===============
   E.G
   // function overloading example
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class A{
    public:
int f1(int x)
{

    cout<<"a  parent class is executed";
}

};
class B : public  A{
public:
int f1(float y)
{
    cout<<"B child class is executed";
}
};

===========Function overriding:======================================
function overriding means when we have same function name and same parameter in the parent class as well as in the child class then it is class over riding 
so if we want to use the function overriding then we use virtual keyword so that it can do late binding and compile in runtime.






int main(){
B object;
int m=5;
object.f1(m);
}
==================================================================
==================================================================
Here B class will execute becuase the scope of the function overloading is not in the same scope and the object that is calling is in the B class

=============================================================================  
Note: in c++ some function or standard library is also function overloaded (sqrt function) that means it can take the value int float doble as parameters\)
